<p>This piece was composed as a gentle exploration of 16-tone equal temperament, specifically written for someone special. The title "Softer for J" reflects both the musical character and the personal inspiration behind the work.</p>

<p>The composition utilizes the unique harmonic possibilities of 16-EDO, where the octave is divided into 16 equal steps rather than the traditional 12. This creates intervals that don't exist in standard tuning, allowing for new types of harmonies and melodic relationships.</p>

    <li>Uses quartertone intervals extensively</li>
    <li>Features gentle, flowing melodic lines</li>
    <li>Explores the softer side of microtonal harmony</li>
</ul>

<p>This piece represents an important step in my exploration of how microtonal systems can express emotion and intimacy, proving that alternative tunings can be just as expressive and beautiful as traditional ones.</p>
